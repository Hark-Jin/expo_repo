The `data.zip` file contains separate CSV files for 10 subjects from each of 2 groups (`con` and `exp`). Each subject is observed over 8 weeks. Please use these data to address / answer the following:

* Create a single tidy dataset based on the separate files
* Make a plot of each subject over 8 weeks
* Summarize week-by-week observations for both groups, numerically and visually

Although you're free to handle this however you find most intuitive, the approach I'd suggest is to use `list.files()` to get a list of file names; use `map` or `map_df` to iterate over files, reading in each one; and then do some data tidying to answer these questions.
